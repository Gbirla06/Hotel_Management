Hotel_Management



-----------Please make sure your graphics are enabled before run-------------

like I built a project about "Hotel Management" in which I used an old version like turbo c++. There is no strong reason for that because I am very familiar with turbo and we dont need to do ant extra setup for graphics. That's it. 

I used purely c++, nothing else, like I was moving. You can see it in a small white circle on the menu.

In this project I am maintaining data of customers like those taking service from a particular hotel, like(ROYAL PALACE). It contains a well designed menu in which you can see

option like:

  1)BOOKING
  2)VIEW MAP
  3)VIEW DATA
  4)CHECK OUT
  5)VIEW ALL
  6)RESTAURENT
  7)EXIT

VIEW DATA: In this, if any relative or person comes to check particular data about a room, I just created who is currently staying in the particular given room.

RESTAURENT: Customers can book delicious foodüòÅüòÅ just because the food is always 'Yummyüëåüòçüòçüòâ' and if the customer is staying in a hotel then he/she gets a discount also.
